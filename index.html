        <b>Introduction</b><br>
        The cucumber plant belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, a part of the Cucumis genus. The Cucumis genus contains nearly 40 species, such as the cantaloupe, and watermelon. The cucumber has many common names including pepino, cetriolo, gherkin, gurke, krastavac, concombre, hunggua, kiukaba, khira, kiukamupa, and kukamba.

        The cucumber is a frost sensitive annual, coarse (large, bold, and rough leaves) and, creeping vine that can reach upwards of six feet in length. The spiraling hairy vine and tendrils that originate from the axil, allows the plant to readily climb supporting structures. Hairy three to five lobed leaves with a triangular shape that are 10 – 40 cm in size are each supported on a petiole and provide a canopy to cover the flowers and fruit. The overall root system is generally shallow (usually penetrates top 30 cm of soil) with lateral roots extending further than the vine; however, a tap root can reach one meter deep.

        The cucumbers’ fruit has a hard, thick, firm outer rind, while being round, triangular-shaped, and is known as a false berry. The fruit goes through two stages, immature and mature. During its’ immature stage chlorophyll in the cells located under the epidermis makes the rind green in color. In the mature stage, the rind changes into a yellow-white color and the epidermal layer may develop warty areas that form a trichome (spiky hair). The fruit has three locules that contain soft tissue, and where the seeds are embedded. The cucumber fruit ranges in colors from yellow, orange, white, and green. A regular cucumber contains seeds and can also be referred to as a seeded cucumber. Regular cucumbers have green stripes on a dark green skin with a rough surface including strong trichomes. They are about 15-25 cm in length and uniformly cylindrical. English cucumbers are evenly green throughout, and long in length about 25-50 cm. The English cucumber is cylindrical in shape with a short narrow neck at the end of the stem and contains either atrophic seeds that are barely identifiable or no seeds.

        <b>Description</b><br>
        The cucumber is a creeping vine that roots in the ground and grows up trellises or other supporting frames, wrapping around supports with thin, spiraling tendrils.[1] The plant may also root in a soilless medium and will sprawl along the ground if it does not have supports. The vine has large leaves that form a canopy over the fruits. The fruit of typical cultivars of cucumber is roughly cylindrical, but elongated with tapered ends, and may be as large as 60 centimeters (24 in) long and 10 centimeters (3.9 in) in diameter.[citation needed] Botanically speaking, the cucumber is classified as a pepo, a type of botanical berry with a hard outer rind and no internal divisions. Much like tomato and squash, it is often perceived, prepared and eaten as a vegetable. Cucumber fruits consist of 95% water.

        <b>History</b><br>
        The cucumber originated in India, where a great many varieties have been observed, from Cucumis hystrix. It has been cultivated for at least 3,000 years, and was probably introduced to other parts of Europe by the Greeks or Romans. Records of cucumber cultivation appear in France in the 9th century, England in the 14th century, and in North America by the mid-16th century.
